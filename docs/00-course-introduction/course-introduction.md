## Why Ruby?

![Happy happy! Joy joy!](ruby_makes_me_happy.png){:class="small inline"}

- Dynamic interpreted languages are gaining popularity (Perl, Python, Javascript, Lua, &c).
- Ruby is free (with a very open license for program distribution)
- Strong programming community (good tutorials, example code, forums, &c)
- Optimized for "Programming Happiness"

If you've got 30 minutes, why don't you [give Ruby a try in your browser](https://try.ruby-lang.org/).

## Ruby Design Principles

- Principle of Least Surprise
- Principle of Succinctness (a.k.a. Principle of Least Effort)
- Write more understandable code in less lines
- Less code means less bugs
- The quicker we program, the more we accomplish

#### Resources

- [Ruby - A programmers best friend](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Ruby @ Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_programming_language)
- A brief discussion of [The Principle of Least Surpirse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)

## Why Rails?

![Hop On The Rails](ruby_rails.png){:class="small inline"}

- Model View Controller (MVC) is becoming the defacto standard for coding web apps.
- Rails code is very DRY (With Rails you **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself)
- Convention over Configuration (Sane defaults but still customizable)
- Open Source with over 4,500 contributors.

_Careful!_ The Rails framework is 'opinionated' meaning that it tries to steer you to code in the 'Rails Way'. If your program becomes overly complex or bogged-down in details, you have drifted from the 'Rails Way'.

## Education, Learning and Responsibility

![You Are Responsible For Your Brain](understanding-the-brain.jpg){:class="small inline"}

_"Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught."_ -- Oscar Wilde

**Understanding Requires Action**

If you find yourself falling behind in your understanding of the course material _please_ contact me, or ask a classmate for help. Remember that **you reap what you sow**. If you put minimal effort into this course you will get very little out of it. This means:

- Reading all assigned reading materials.
- Completing (and understanding) all challenges.
- Mastering the Rails / Ruby documentation.
- Typing out Code (No Copypasta)
- Experimentation is better than Stack Overflow and Google-coding
- Permission for Failure / Learning from Mistakes
