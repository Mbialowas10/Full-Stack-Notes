## Constants

You can also create constants in Ruby. A constant holds a value that you do not expect to change. Constant names must start with a capital letter.

Unlike other languages, Ruby allows you to change the values in constants by assigning a new value to them:

```ruby
NUMBER_OF_ARMS = 2
NUMBER_OF_ARMS = 1
```

However, you'll get a warning each time you do this:

```
warning: already initialized constant NUMBER_OF_ARMS
```

## Variables

Ruby can store your data in variables. Variables are named placeholders that can store numbers, strings, and other data. Any lowercase word is a variable in ruby. Variables may consist of letters, digits and underscores.

You reference the data stored in a variable by using the variableâ€™s name. For example, to store a value of `-5` in a variable named `temperature_on_mars`, you assign that variable the value.

```ruby
temperature_on_mars = -5
puts temperature_on_mars * 2
```

On the second line of the above program we are outputting twice the value of the number stored in our variable.

## Strings

Strings are any sort of characters (letters, digits, punctuation) surrounded by quotes. Both single and double quotes are used to create strings.

```ruby
opening_line  = 'It was the best of times.'
movie_trailer = "In a land that time forgot, "
```

### Concatenation

We can add to a Strings by using the plus operator.

```ruby
opening_line   = opening_line + " It was the blurst of times."
movie_trailer += 'there grew a ninja '
movie_trailer += "who would never be forgotten."
```

## Expression Interpolation

Ruby performs expression interpolation on double-quoted strings using the `#{}` interpolation wrapper.

So instead of this:

```ruby
time = "4 o'clock"
state_of_town = "all is well"
town_crier = "It's " + time + " and " + state_of_town + "."
```

We can do this:

```ruby
town_crier = "It's #{time} and #{state_of_town}."
```

_Note: Expression interpolation will not work with single quoted strings._

## Numbers - Integers

The most basic type of number is an integer, a series of digits which can start with a plus or minus sign.

Commas are not allowed in numbers, but underscores are. If you choose, you can make large numbers more readable by marking your thousands with underscores.

```ruby
very_large_number  = 34_000_000_001
even_larger_number = very_large_number * 12_345
puts "Whoa #{even_larger_number} is a large number!"
```

Output:

```
Whoa 419730000012345 is a large number!
```

## Numbers - Floats

In Ruby decimal numbers are called floats. They consist of a number with a decimal place or a number that uses scientific notation.

```ruby
ALMOST_PI = 3.14
AVOGADROS_CONSTANT = 6.02214179e23
```

Note that both of these variables are constants because their names begin with a capital letter.
